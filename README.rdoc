= Vector2d

Vector2d allows for easy handling of two-dimensionals coordinates and vectors.
It's very flexible, most methods accepts arguments as strings, arrays, hashes
or Vector2d objects.

== Installation

Install from RubyForge:

  sudo gem install vector2d

Install from GitHub:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install elektronaut-vector2d

== Usage examples

  require 'vector2d'

  # These are equal
  v = Vector2d.new(50, 70)  
  v = Vector2d.new('50x70')

  v.aspect_ratio # => 0.714285714285714
  v.length       # => 86.0232526704263

  # Calculations work as expected
  v * 2                   # => #<Vector2d:0x5d994 @y=140.0, @x=100.0>
  v + Vector2d.new(20,30) # => #<Vector2d:0x59c54 @y=100.0, @x=70.0>

  v.constrain_both(64, 64) # => #<Vector2d:0x47e28 @y=64.0, @x=45.7142857142857>
